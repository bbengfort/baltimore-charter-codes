suspended because of political opinions or affiliations, or for refusing to contribute to any
political fund or refusing to render any political service.  But nothing in this Charter relating
to the Civil Service forbids the discharge, reduction in pay or position, or suspension of an
officer or employee for any just cause.

  (2)Whenever a non-probationary employee is discharged, reduced in pay or position, or
suspended for more than 30 days, the appointing officer shall furnish a copy of the order of
discharge, reduction, or suspension, together with a statement of the reasons for the action, to
the employee and to the Commission.

  (3)The employee may contest the action by:

    (i)requesting a hearing before the Commission; or

    (ii)initiating a grievance pursuant to an applicable grievance and arbitration procedure, if
any, contained in an applicable collective bargaining agreement.

  (4)Once an employee has chosen to contest an action by electing one of the procedures specified
in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the employee is bound by that election and may not
subsequently choose to follow a different procedure.

(5)In all cases, except one in which an employee elects to contest an action through a grievance
and arbitration procedure under paragraph (3)(ii) of this subsection, the Commission may,
and on the written request of the employee, the Commission shall investigate the disciplinary
action.  If the Commission finds that the intent and spirit of the provisions of this Charter
have been violated in the discharge, reduction, or suspension, it shall report its findings to the
Mayor; and the appointing officer shall take whatever action the Commission directs to
rectify the violation.
